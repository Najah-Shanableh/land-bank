Cook County Land Bank Strategy Evaluation

Introduction
------------

The CCLB would like us to score properties based on their desirability
for acquisition. However, its strategies will differ from community
to community, and a variety of approaches have been suggested. Before
we can assign scores, we need to know what success and failure look
like, and what kinds of treatments will be applied.

Therefore, part of our job for the fellowship program will be to:

1. Set out a list of possible strategies based on the conversations
we've had with stakeholders.

2. Propose some explicit goals and tactics for each strategy.

3. Using historical data, evaluate each strategy to estimate its
probability of success, its most appropriate target communities, and
its possible pitfalls.

------------

Strategy 1: Demolish vacant buildings in neighborhoods with little demand.

  Goals: 
         * Reduce the quality-of-life and public safety issues that result
           from vacant and abandoned buildings.

         * Bring supply in line with demand.

         * Assemble blocks of land that may be combined in future developments.

  Assessment strategies:
         * Quantify the quality-of-life and public safety issues. Is there
           a measurable effect on crime, disorder, property values, etc. in
           the vicinity of vacant buildings? The indices and CPD groups may
           bring their efforts to bear on this question as well.

         * Look at past demolitions by the City of Chicago, etc. to see whether
           they had a measurable effect.

         * Look at property development in struggling neighborhoods to see
           if multiple adjacent vacant parcels are more likely to be developed.

         * Evaluate effectiveness of other land banks with a similar strategy,
           e.g. Cuyahoga.

Strategy 2: Rehab vacant buildings and rent them out.

  Goals: 
         * Preserve historical housing stock and neighborhood character.

         * Supply affordable housing to people who need it.

         * Bring price-to-rent ratios in line by balancing the supply
           and demand of owner-occupied versus rental properties.

  Assessment strategies:
         * Look at Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) effectiveness.

         * Assess demand for rentals and affordable rent levels versus
           rehab costs in various neighborhoods.

         * Gather information from nonprofit developers like Bickerdike
           about the demand for their properties in struggling areas.

Strategy 3: Develop properties in transit-accessible areas zoned for 
            multi-family housing.

  Goals:
         * Put affordable housing in neighborhoods rich with rail
           transit and vocational services.

         * Focus on areas with characterists that have proven desirable
           in Chicago and other major cities. (Everyone loves good schools
	   and parks, what we care about access to employment, safety and
	   healthcare.)

         * Encourage reinvestment in communities that have experienced 
	  long-term population decline but are close to low-skill 
	  employment opportunities and vocational education resources. 


  Assessment strategies:
         * Look at the success and failure of developments in neighborhoods
           that saw some investment during the boom, such as East Garfield 
           Park.

         * Evaluate similar efforts in other cities, such as the South Bronx
           in NYC.

	 * Compare single family home price trends in areas near low income
	   rental units with those near vacant housing units and undeveloped 
	   land.

	 * Compare retail sales in areas near low income
	   rental units with those near vacant housing units and undeveloped 
	   land.

Strategy 4: Targeted interventions in tipping-point neighborhoods.

  Goals:
         * Work on the margins to make sure that a couple vacant properties
           on an otherwise intact block don't cause the neighborhood to
           spiral out of control.

         * Ensure that long-standing, tightly-knit communities don't collapse.
 
         * Maximize the bank's dollars and effectiveness early on by focusing
           on the areas with the best "bang for the buck."

  Assessment strategies:
         * Identify some case studies: neighborhoods where foreclosures led
           to cascading disinvestment. (E.g. Roseland)

         * Look for leading indicators of rapid decline.

         * Look at intact blocks in areas like West Humboldt Park to see
           if foreclosures took place, and if so, how they were handled.
